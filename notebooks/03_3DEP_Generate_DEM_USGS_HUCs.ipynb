    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The United States Geological Survey's 3-D Elevation Program (3DEP) is collecting high-quality light detection and ranging (lidar) data over the conterminous U.S., Hawaii, and the U.S territories. Data acquisition is ongoing, with over 1800 3DEP datasets consisting of more than 42 trillion points covering an area of greater than 6.5 million $km^{2}$ already available for use. Data are hosted and publically available in Entwine Point Tile (EPT) format in an<a href=\"https://registry.opendata.aws/usgs-lidar/\"> Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 public bucket</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "3DEP point cloud data can be accessed through several user interfaces including the <a href=\"https://portal.opentopography.org/datasets\">OpenTopography Data Portal</a> and the <a href=\"https://prd-tnm.s3.amazonaws.com/LidarExplorer/index.html#/process\">USGS Lidar Explorer</a>. In many cases, however, users may prefer to access and produce derivative products from the 3DEP lidar data programmatically, particularly in the case of more advanced users seeking to access and process immense swaths of lidar point cloud data on local, commercial cloud, or high performance compute infrastructure. However, to date tools and/or workflows for programmatic access and processing of the 3DEP data remain underdeveloped.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook is part of a suite developed by OpenTopography in collaboration with the USGS National Geospatial Program, in an effort to leverage available APIs and cloud resources to enhance access and usability of 3DEP data and products for the geospatial community. Importantly, these notebooks are designed to be accessible by user's with limited experience in the Python programming language and as educational tools for those looking to learn about accessing, processing, and visualizing cloud-hosted data with Python. These notebooks use open-source Python libraries, including the Point Data Abstraction Libary (PDAL) and Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) for all point cloud and raster processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "This and the other use-case specific Jupyter Notebooks developed as part of this effort for programmatic 3DEP access are available in a <a href=\"https://github.com/cmspeed/OT_3DEP_Workflows\"> Github repository </a> and may be run locally or on the <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/\">Google Colaboratory</a> cloud platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specific features of this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "1. User selects a point location on an interactive map and the corresponding USGS 12-digit (Sub-watershed) or 14-digit hydrologic unit (HU) is requested via the <a href= \"https://hydro.nationalmap.gov/arcgis/rest/services/wbd/MapServer/\"> USGS Watershed Boundary Dataset Map Service </a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. API request to <a href=\"https://registry.opendata.aws/usgs-lidar/\"> Amazon Web Services (AWS) EPT (Entwine Point Tile) S3 bucket</a> returns 3DEP point cloud data within user-defined 12- or 14-digit hydrologic unit (HU) for subsequent processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Flexible and customizable PDAL pipelines are available for specifying point cloud resolution, filtering, reclassifying, and reprojecting points.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Option to create a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) or Digital Surface Model (DSM) for the hydrologic unit with user-specifed resolution, gridding method, and file type.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Point cloud data and/or derivative products are saved to local directory or on Google Drive (if user uses Google Colaboratory option, see below.)\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Funding\n",
    "\n",
    "Funding for the creation and distribution of these Jupyter Notebook-based workflows was provided as by the <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/centers/community-for-data-integration-cdi\">USGS Community for Data Integration (CDI)</a> through the funded grant <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/centers/community-for-data-integration-cdi/science/enhancing-usability-3dep-data-and-web-services\"> *Enhancing usability of 3DEP data and web services with Jupyter notebooks*</a>.

    "There are two options for performing the workflow steps outlined below. **Option 1** is our suggested method for simplicity, as building a virtual environment with the required dependencies on the user's local file system can be challenging based on the user's experience level with Python and <a href=\"https://www.anaconda.com/\"> Anaconda</a>.\n",

    "Importantly, after the map is rendered, the user must define the desired 'point cloud resolution' using the radio buttons below the map. An estimation of the total number of lidar points within the bounding box is provided based on the area of the AOI and the total number of lidar points in the 3DEP dataset(s). Selecting the \"Full\" option will return all points in the quad (this number will be quite large, >1 billion points in some cases). Selecting any of the other options for resoltuion will return the appropriate number of points to ensure at least one lidar point per Nth meter (where N is the chosen resolution). The user is not alone if they are at least somewhat confused by the concept of resolution in this sense. The Entwine Point Tile (EPT) file format utilizes an octree structure for the point cloud, and in essense, the chosen resolution defines how deep in the octree to request points to obtain the specified resolution. This depth, and total number points varies drastically based on a number of parameters including local topography and vegetation. Therefore, the 'resolution' paramater and the total point count do not scale linearly. In other words, specifying a resolution of 2m will likely return far less than half of the number of points returned with 'full' resolution. The estimate of the full poin total provided is not exact, but should give the user some idea of how many points to expect the resultant point cloud to contain. \n",
